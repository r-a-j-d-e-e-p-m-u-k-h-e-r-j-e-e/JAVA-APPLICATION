# Description of our app:

In this repository, we define the graphical user interface (GUI) of a mobile phone homescreen application coded in Java that can be launched on any laptop/computer using an IDE. The purpose of this code is to create a homescreen interface that displays a grid of icons representing various applications installed on a smartphone. Users can click on these icons to launch the corresponding applications. We have a few apps including a scientific calculcator; a graphing calculator; an app for YouTube; an app for painting on a white canvas in the form of Pixel art and a music app that opens up windows for playing the paino, guitar or drums.

The purpose of building an app that represents a smartphone screen with built-in apps is to create a realistic simulation of a smartphone interface that users can interact with. This type of app is commonly used for demonstration, education, or testing purposes. For demonstration purposes, the app can be used to showcase the features and functionality of a particular smartphone model or operating system. This can be useful for sales representatives or product demonstrations where users may not have access to the physical device. For educational purposes, the app can be used to teach users how to use various features and functions of a smartphone, such as navigating the home screen, opening and closing apps, and adjusting settings. For testing purposes, the app can be used to test the compatibility and functionality of other mobile apps. For example, developers may use this type of app to test how their app functions on different smartphone models and operating systems. Overall, the purpose of building an app that represents a smartphone screen with built-in apps is to create a convenient and easy-to-use tool for demonstrating, teaching, and testing smartphone functionality.

We plan on collaborating with each other and honing in our efforts together for establishing the homescreen of a modern-day smartphone and building apps on it. Currently, we have multiple different apps and we are expanding our base and connecting all of them together. We are open to collaborate with other creators if they want to join us in our project. We will be working on the various different applications within this "mega app" and integrating them together for as much of a seamless flow as possible.

# Instruction on how to use our app:

### Initial steps:
1) Clone the repository into your computer using any IDE you prefer
2) Import the JavaFX modules as refernce libraries
3) Run the code either using Powershell, Debugger or the Run button after launch(args)

## Running different codes for our apps:
### Home Screen
Once you have successfully cloned the repo into your IDE and the program is set, go to the file named SmartphoneHomeScreen_1.java file and run it. It will open up the Home Screen display containing all the buttons to access the different apps.

### YouTube app
Open the Youtubeviewer.java file as found under the main branch src folder and run it. It should open up YouTube app using Java webbrowser. It is important that you have internet connection while running this code.

### PixelArt app
Open the paint.java file as found under the main branch src folder and run it. It should open up a white canvas with options to change the colour, thickness of the pixel 'brush', shape and their thickness. You can now draw your masterpiece and can even save it onto a file of your choice.

### MusicalInstruments app
Open the MusicalInstruments.java file as found under the  src folder in Music branch and run it. It will launch a window with three musical instruments you can choose to play. Clicking on anyone of the buttons will cause the launching of that instrument's GUI.

### Piano app GUI
Open the piano.java file as found under the src folder in Music branch and run it. It will launch a GUI that represents a virtual piano. Clicking on the white and black keys will make the respective sound of that key.

### Guitar app GUI
Open the GuitarApp.java file as found under the src folder in Drums and Guitar branch and run it. It will launch a GUI that represents a virtual guitar fretboard. Upon expanding the window, you can see the different buttons for the various chords. The buttons are intended to be layed over the fretboard so that they represent the sound note of a guitarist holding that string at different points. Clicking on the respective buttons will generate the corresponding music for it.

### Drums app GUI
Open the DrumsApp.java file as found under the src folder in Drums and Guitar branch and run it. It will launch a GUI that represents a virtual drum set. You can see the different buttons for the various different parts of a drum set. Clicking on the respective buttons will generate the corresponding music for it.

### Calculator app
Open the Calculator.java file as found under the src folder in master branch and run it. It will launch the GUI for a scientific calculator that is able to perform addition, subtraction, trignometric ratios, inverse trignometric, logarithmic, etc. Click on the buttons to perform whichever function you want to.

### Graphing calculator app
Open the calc.java file as found under the src folder in master branch and run it. It will launch the GUI for a graphing calculator that is able to graph out functions based on the equation entered as is displayed in the window as bounded by XMin and XMax for X-axis and YMax and YMin for Y-axis. Currently it is set for a scatter plot but it can be changed if you so desire by replacing scatterchart with linechart throughout.
